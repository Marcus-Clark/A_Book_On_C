// I know it's not the current topic, and it's related to computer languages
// just as strongly as to English, still I thought maybe you'd appreciate this:
//
// There's a contest for abusing the C programming language, the International
// Obfuscated C Code Contest (www.ioccc.org). One of my favourite people who
// regularly participate is Brian Westley. One of his programs is completely
// symmetric (each line is a palindrome): http://www.ioccc.org/1987/westley.c
//
// Maybe you think this has nothing to do with English. Maybe this'll help you
// change your mind: http://www.ioccc.org/1990/westley.c
